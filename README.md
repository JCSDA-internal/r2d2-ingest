## Scripts

This repository contains a variety of sample Python scripts and associated configuration YAML files for storing and 
fetching data files with R2D2. Scripts are arranged by either the `provider` or `model` followed
by data type such as `an`, `fb`, `fc`, `media`, or `obs`. All `obs` directories are organized by `obs_type`.

The `util` directory contains scripts for converting previous versions of the R2D2 database
paths for `an`, `bc`, `fc`, and `obs` data types.
